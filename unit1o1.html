<h2 id="example">Purpose IT in Modern Business.</h2>
<div class="center">
<p><b>1.1</b> The role of IT in business is seen in how it can help companies become more productive, increase performance, save money, improve the customer experience, streamline communications and enhance managerial decision-making. It also plays a role in helping companies expand globally and in providing staff access to company information wherever and whenever they need it.
<br>
<br>
Other examples of IT's role in business include the following:
<ol>
<li>Helps improve business security and reduce risks of theft and loss of confidential information.</li>
<li>IT allows companies to store important company data in a database in the cloud to reduce paper waste, increase security and allow for easy backups.</li>
<li>IT allows companies to expand internationally as easily as setting up a multi-language website that markets to global customers and allows purchases in multiple currencies.</li>
<li>Companies can use online recruitment to find more qualified job candidates and handle most of the hiring process online.</li>
<li>Thanks to IT, getting the latest information about your competitors and the market is as easy as searching Google on your computer or smartphone.</li>

<p><b>1.2</b> Digital projects are products which are developed and delivered digitally. In order for these projects to succeed they must go through five steps:
<ol>
<li><b>Scoping</b> - Scoping is the initial phase. Here you brainstorm the idea. </li>
<li><b>Planning</b> - After the initial first phase, the more detailed planning can begin.</li>
<li><b>Development</b> - The implementation can now begin.</li>
<li><b>Testing & Deployment</b> - Deployment is the final stage before the product will be in the hands of the end-user. Everything needs to be tested and various use-cases must be taken into account.</li>
<li><b>Maintenance</b> - After the product has been delivered, the Maintenance phase will take over. Maintenance is a continuous phase of improving functionality, stability, and offering support of the product.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Digital tools are software used to help organize work and collaborate with colleagues on projects. These include material to encode, computer with text editor or Visual Studio Code, software to process the encoding.
<br>
<br>
The skills needed iclude:
<ol>
<li>Collaboration.</li>
<li>Strong communication and organizational skills.</li>
<li>Problem solver.</li>
<li>Attention to detail.</li>
<li>Ability to multi-task and prioritize.</li>
<li>Goal- and results-driven.</li>
<li>Get things done.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</div>

<div class="center">
<p><b>1.3</b> To design my website, I started with making folders for my website and saved them on my desktop including all the images I need. I started to design the skeleton of the website encoding through Visual Studio Code. I also used reference sources like W3 Schools and Slack. Once the website was finished, I uploaded it on trello <a href="https://trello.com/b/Q1SgrrLs/my-website" target="_blank">link</a> and the final project will be on Github.
 </p></div>
 
 <div class="center">
<p><b>1.4</b> There are many reasons why digital projects to fail. These include;
<ol>
<li>Communication mishaps.</li>
<li>Treating your first release like your last release.</li>
<li>Not being engaged.</li>
<li>Not keeping up to date with digital tools.</li>
<li>Not planning for post-launch.</li>
</ol>
</p></div>

<div class="center">
<p><b>1.5</b> The right technology for the job is the “best” technology. To select the right IT system and software for a job, you need to know who will be using the software, if it is functional, can you test drive it before you implement it, is there a support system you can implement with new software and what to do if it does work. </p>
</div>

<div class="center">
<p><b>1.6</b> <b>Trello</b> has helped me and my team easily keep track of  project plans, tasks, and our progress. The tasks are placed on cards and team members who are assigned to those tasks are added to the card. The card moves through the workflow as progress is made on completing the task. All files necessary for certain analysis are also held together and people can add in their code, graphs, etc. as the projects develop.
<br>
<br>
<b>Git</b> is a version control tool that has allowed me to perform all kinds of operations to fetch data from the central server or push data to it and <b>Github</b> is a core hosting platform for version control collaboration. GitHub has allowed me to host a central repository in a remote server.</p>

<p><b>1.7 Legal Guidelines (GDPR) and Constraints:</b></p>

<p>On May 25th 2018 the <b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b> came into legal force and effect. The regulation replaced the Data Protection Directive (1995) and has a far-reaching impact on individuals and organisations in all sectors globally.
<br>
<br>
<b>GDPR</b> will require you to be more thoughtful about the sites and services you build, more transparent about the ways you collect and use data, more considerate of your users, and more thorough in your development and documentation processes.</p>
