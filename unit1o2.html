        <p><b>2.1.</b> Visual Studio Code or VSC for short is designed by Miscrosft as a cross-platform code editor for writing on the web and cloud application. It is one of the most popular source code editors used by programmers. It is fast, it is lightweight and it is powerful. I am happy using VSC because I find it easy to use and it provides live coding regardless of the programming language.

            Trello is a wonderful tool for managing tasks and projects. The visual Kanban boards are flexible, shareable, and let you pack a ton of detail into each card. Trello is also good for organizing just about anything, even my entire life.</p>
            </div>
        
        <div class="center">
        <p><b>2.2.</b> The IT tools that were selected were appropriate for my project. They minimized confusion around project assignments with simple tools to organize tasks and track progress. They offered accurate and live coding.</p>

        <div class="center">
        <p><b>2.3.</b> The strengths of my final project are that I got to learn a lot in such a short period of time. I am proud of what I have achieved and I like the look of my website. The weaknesses are time constraits. I feel that the final project was too wordy for the time we had to do it in and I felt that I was doing more typing that designing. If I had more time, I would have spent it on designing the website and probably do a much better job especially incorporating some of the effects we were taught. I would have liked to insert more pictures too.</p>
    </div>
            
         <div class="center">
        <p><b>2.4</b> I am still not confident with the code so everything I have been doing has been trial and error. The mistake I made was to do the write up before designing the skeleton of the website because that took up a lot of my time. The improvements I would make on my website is to make it more interactive and responsive. Right now it is too wordy!</p>
    </div>
           
        <div class="center">
        <p><b>2.5</b> The coutcomes to match requirements would be using CSS to make the website more responsive.</p>

        <p><b>3.1.</b> The benefits of IT tools and systems in terms of productivity and efficiency that
            <ol>
            <li>They minimise confusionaround project assignments.</li>
            <li>Help organize tasks and track progress.</li>
            <li>Customizable lists that allow users to follow metrics they are most interested in and use automated notifications to keep informed of all changes.</li>

        <div class="center">
        <p><b>3.2.</b> There are only so many hours in the day, so making the most of your time is critical. The two ways to improve productivity and efficieny is to either put in more hours or work smarter. I don't know about you, but I prefer the latter. The way to do this is by;
        <ol>
            <li>Tracking and limiting how much time you're spending on tasks.</li>
            <li>Taking regular breaks.</li>
            <li>Set yourself deadlines.</li>
            <li>Do not multitask.</li>
            <li>Minimise interruptions.</li>
            <li>Be proactive, not reactive</li>
        </ol></p>

        <div class="center">
            <p><b>3.3.</b> What I would do differently next time to improve productivity using IT in digital projects is:
                <ol>
                    <li>Organize and plan tasks.</li>
                    <li>Pay attention to detail.</li>
                    <li>Communicate better.</li>
                    <li>Breakdown work structure.</li>
                </ol>
           
            I would also use IT tools like <b>Slack</b> and <b>Trello</b> more readily in order to help me organize, track and break down work structure.

                <p><b>3.4.</b> To test digital solutions you must:
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Choose your target market / audience.</li>
                        <li>What devices and software are used to access your site.</li>
                        <li>Establish functions of the device / browser, for example, printing, page zooming, page sizing, copy/ paste, etc.</li>
                        <li>Check for error messages, pop ups, pop out pages, overlays.</li>
