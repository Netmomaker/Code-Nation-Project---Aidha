<h4 id="example">Content and Layout.</h4>
<p><b>1.1. Page 1:</b> This is the <b>Home/ About me</b> page. It is the introduction to my blog. It introduces the reader to me and why I love technology.
The layout is standard to all pages (apart from the contact page) with the header at the top wich is my blog logo, the navigation bar is on the left, content is in the middle of page and at the bottom is the footer.
<br>
<br>
<b>Page 2:</b> Is <b>Unit 1: Outcome 1</b> which tells the reader about the purpose of IT in modern business, what tools, methods and resources are needed for digital projects to succeed, how these tools are selected, why digital projects fail and the legal guidelines and constraints that impact them.
<br>
<br>
<b>Page 3:</b> Is <b>Unit 1: Outcome 2</b> which reviews the ongoing use of IT tools like <b>Visual studio code, Trello and Github.</b> Their strengths and weakesses as well as their benefits and drawbacks in terms of productivity and efficiency; if they were the right tool to use for your project and if you are happy with them; how they can be improved; how they improved productivity and efficiency and how to test them.
<br>
<br>  
<b>Page 4:</b> This is <b>Unit 2: Outcome 1</b> which describes the content layout of the website; copyrights and constraints; access issues for people with disabilities and access of filetypes for websites.
<br>
<br>
<b>Page 5:</b> Is the <b>Contact</b> page and has my contact details.
The layout has the blog logo at the top of the page and the footer at the bottom. The content is in the middle.</p>

<p><b>1.5.</b> The online world allows for the free flow of information, including text and graphics.
However, this accessibility leads to a common problem: Your online content, no matter its form, is easy for unscrupulous parties to steal and claim as their own. 
<br>
<br>
Copyright refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression.
<br>
<br>
The law in the U.K. under the <b>Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</b> works are protected upon creation, meaning as soon as you post your website, you enjoy copyright protection. However, the U.K. Copyright Service highly recommends registration because websites are subject to abuse and that process allows a civil cause of action. To remind users of this protection, many websites add copyright notices to the footer.

<p><b>1.6.</b> The main access issues that affect people with disabilities are;
<ol>
<li><b>Visual Blindness</b> - low vision and colour-blindness.</li>
<li><b>Auditory</b> - Profoundly deaf and hard of hearing.</li>
<li><b>Motor</b> -The inability to use a mouse, slow response time, limited fine motor control.</li>
<li><b>Cognitive</b> - Learning difficulties, distractibility, the inability to focus on large amounts of information.</li>
</ol> 
<br>
We can overcome these by:
<ol>
    <li><b>Visual</b> - make it easy to read.</li>
    <li><b>Auditory</b> - make it easy to hear.</li>
    <li><b>Motor</b> -make it easy to interact.</li>
    <li><b>Cognitive</b> - make it easy to understand and focus.</li>
    </ol> 

</p></div>
 
 <div class="center">
<p><b>1.7.</b> The appropriate filetypes for websites would be using a colour oracle filter. Take, for example, <b>Amazon</b>. Itâ€™s a huge website with a lot of interactive content, but it generates just five errors on the Wave test, and is easy to read under a Color Oracle filter.</p>
