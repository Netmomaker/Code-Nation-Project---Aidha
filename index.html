    Hello and welcome to my blog. My name is Aida and I am adorkable; not really a techie, but not really a non-techie. My primary interest is in fashion design. I want to create a website that celebrates my passion. 
<br>
<br>
    I have also always had a fascination for technology and have always been intrigued with the way it simplifies and makes everything accessible just by a click of a button. 
<br>
<br>  
    My curiosity saw me enrolling on a course with Code Nation for three weeks where I  learned to code in python, HTML and CSS. At the end of the course, I had a better understanding of how technology worked, how to build websites and design games.

<br>
<br>
    I am now dreaming of big money months, working from home in my yoga pants and having time to spend with the family and do the things that I love everyday!
